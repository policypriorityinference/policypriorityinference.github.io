Since 2015, national and local governments around the world have been constructing new development indicators to track their progress towards the United Nations 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the international community, this has become a common practice inherited from previous global initiatives such as the Human Development Report and the Millennium Development Project. Development indicators are typically used to –ex-post– evaluate outcomes. However, governments could take greater advantage of them, for example, to –ex-ante– understand how some policy priorities are more or less effective in reaching specific development goals. This particular problem, often referred to as policy prioritisation, is especially challenging due to complex interconnections between policy issues, uncertainties in the policymaking process, and a variety of incentives and behaviours that give place to inefficiencies in the use of public funds.
