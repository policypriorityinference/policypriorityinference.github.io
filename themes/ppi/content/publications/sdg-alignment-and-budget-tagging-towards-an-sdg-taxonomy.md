As part of the Decade of Action (2020-2030), the United Nations system began im- plementing the global initiative to strengthen national financing frameworks for the SDGs, known as Integrated National Financing Frameworks or INFF. A significant part of the analysis of all sources of financing for the SDGs is the public budget. This document presents guidelines for (i) aligning public budgets (and development coo- peration) to the SDGs, and (ii) presents relevant inputs for developing local SDG ta- xonomies to explore public budget and private sector contribution to SDG Financing. The guidelines are presented in a step-by-step way to aid users in tailoring to local circumstances the analysis of SDG Financing and are based on the implementation of SDG budget tagging by the INFF-Colombia Joint Program.
