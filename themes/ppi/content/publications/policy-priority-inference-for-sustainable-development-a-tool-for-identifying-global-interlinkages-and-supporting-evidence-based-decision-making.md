This chapter presents the Policy Priority Inference model. It describes how this model, through the identification of positive and negative spillovers between policy dimensions within and between countries, as well as agent- based modelling, can inform policy and budgeting decision-making processes to accelerate development. It also describes how the model, developed by academia, was adapted to the SDGs and piloted with real- world data in Mexico. Building on the outcomes of the pilot project, the chapter reflects on the various historical and prospective analyses the tool can generate to help governments make evidence-based decisions to optimise progress on the SDGs.
