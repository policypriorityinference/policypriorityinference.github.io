The United Nations 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs) has turned into a useful framework to coordinate international efforts across a variety of development issues. In our experience from academic and policy work, we find that the SDGs serve an - often not obvious - function of crucial importance to technical teams working on PFMs, thus <em>enabling the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to understand the impact of budgeting strategies and policy priorities</em>. As an interface between PFM and AI, the SDGs offer a tremendous potential to fully exploit existing datasets on public spending and development indicators; a potential that traditional statistical and benchmarking analyses are unable to tap into.
