<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.5rem;">The tutorials will take you from pre-processing raw data on development indicators and government spending to performing more sophisticated counterfactual analysis such as detecting bottlenecks.</span>

You can view the tutorials via this page, and access the source code through <a href="https://github.com/oguerrer/ppi/tutorials">GitHub</a>. In the official repository, you will find that much of the content makes reference to the forthcoming book: <em>Complexity Economics and Sustainable Development</em>, which will come out later in 2023. For the time being, you can use the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4101378">latest PPI paper</a>Â as the main scientific reference.
